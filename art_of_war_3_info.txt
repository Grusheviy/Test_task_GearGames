  –¢–µ–∫—Å—Ç —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è: There's a bit problem with the connection serve, sometimes while I'm playing it's start getting a bit laggy, connection always lost mid fight, and sometimes when I try to reload the game it crash. It's a good game btw just the problem is it's kinda unfair balancing. I'm playing as Resistance, sure you can grow advantage as hiding in the bushes, put mines and stuff but Confederation player seems gotta be the problem here like hacking or sum, you guys need to check the game again. Thanks.

  –¢–µ–∫—Å—Ç —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è: The game is fun, but the time it takes to unlock everything is just too long. My friend quit playing because there was no way for us to enjoy multiplayer battles; I was ahead of him which would mean an instant win. It would be perfect if casual players can play on a same playingfield to play 1v1 or 2v2.
